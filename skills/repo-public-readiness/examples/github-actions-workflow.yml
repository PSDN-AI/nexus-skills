# Example: Run Repo Public Readiness Scanner in GitHub Actions
#
# Copy this file to .github/workflows/readiness.yml in your repository.
# The scanner runs on every push and PR, and fails the build if findings
# are CRITICAL (NOT_READY).
# For stable pipelines, pin to a release tag (for example @v0.0.1).
